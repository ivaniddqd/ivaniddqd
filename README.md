# Hello, world 🖐️ !

**DevOps / Platform Engineer (5+ years)**  
Terraform • CI/CD • Kubernetes (GKE) • GitOps • Observability • GCP/AWS

I build and automate cloud infrastructure, delivery pipelines, and observability
to keep production systems reliable, scalable, and cost-efficient.

## Focus
- **Cloud & IaC:** Terraform, GCP/AWS, networking, access control, dev/prod separation
- **CI/CD & Delivery:** GitHub Actions/GitLab CI/Jenkins/Bitbucket, releases, rollbacks, automation
- **Kubernetes & GitOps:** GKE, Helm, Argo CD, controlled/auditable changes
- **Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, SigNoz/Datadog, alerting (Alertmanager/Slack)
- **Cost & Reliability:** right-sizing, scaling, cost as a first-class concern
- **Docs as Code:** MkDocs, runbooks, onboarding, architecture docs

## Highlights
- ✅ Terraform-based infrastructure automation
- ✅ CI/CD across multiple platforms, reproducible releases + rollback
- ✅ GitOps delivery with Argo CD
- ✅ Full observability stacks (metrics/logs/dashboards/alerts)
- ✅ Reliability improvements with cost control
